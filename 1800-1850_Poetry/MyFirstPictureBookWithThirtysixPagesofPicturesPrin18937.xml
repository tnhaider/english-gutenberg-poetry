    <head>THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE .</head>
    <head>Once on a time there was a Little Old Woman who lived in a Shoe . This shoe stood near a great forest , and was so large that it served as a house for the Old Lady and all her children , of which she had so many that she did not know what to do with them .</head>
     <l n="1">[ Illustration : Old Woman with children and Shoe . ]</l>
   </lg>
   <p>But the Little Old Woman was very fond of her children , and they only thought of the best way to please her . Strong-arm , the eldest , cut down trees for firewood . Peter made baskets of wicker-work . Mark was chief gardener . Lizzie milked the cow , and Jenny taught the younger children to read .</p>
   <p>Now this Little Old Woman had not always lived in a Shoe . She and her family had once dwelt in a nice house covered with ivy , and her husband was a wood-cutter , like Strong-arm . But there lived in a huge castle beyond the forest , a fierce giant , who one day came and laid their house in ruins with his club ; after which he carried off the poor wood-cutter to his castle beyond the forest . When the Little Old Woman came home , her house was in ruins and her husband was no where to be seen .</p>
   <figure>

   </figure>
   <p>Night came on , and as the father did not return , the Old Lady and her family went to search for him . When they came to that part of the wood where the Giant had met their father , they saw an immense shoe . They spent a long time weeping and calling out for their father , but met with no reply . Then the Old Lady thought that they had better take shelter in the shoe until they could build a new house . So Peter and Strong-arm put a roof to it , and cut a door , and turned it into a dwelling . Here they all lived happily for many years , but the Little Old Lady never forgot her husband and his sad fate . Strong-arm , who saw how wretched his mother often was about it , proposed to the next eleven brothers that they should go with him and set their father free from the Giant . Their mother knew the Giant 's strength , and would not hear of the attempt , as she feared they would be killed . But Strong-arm was not afraid . He bought a dozen sharp swords , and Peter made as many strong shields and helmets , as well as cross-bows and iron-headed arrows . They were now quite ready ; Strong-arm gave the order to march , and they started for the forest . The next day they came in sight of the Giant 's Castle . Strong-arm , leaving his brothers in a wood close by , strode boldly up to the entrance , and seized the knocker . The door was opened by a funny little boy with a large head , who kept grinning and laughing .</p>
   <figure>

   </figure>
   <p>Strong-arm then walked boldly across the court-yard , and presently met a page , who took off his hat and asked him what he wanted . Strong-arm said he had come to liberate his father , who was kept a prisoner by the Giant ; on this the little man said he was sorry for him , because the part of the castle in which his father was kept was guarded by a large dragon . Strong-arm , nothing daunted , soon found the monster , who was fast asleep , so he made short work of him by sending his sword right through his heart ; at which he jumped up , uttering a loud scream , and made as if he would spring forward and seize Strong-arm ; but the good sword had done its work , and the monster fell heavily on the ground , dead .</p>
   <figure>

   </figure>
   <p>Now the Giant , who had been drinking much wine , was fast asleep in a remote part of the castle . Strong-arm had no sooner finished the Dragon , than up started the funny little boy who had opened the door . He led Strong-arm round to another part of the court-yard , where he saw his poor father , who at once sprung to his feet , and embraced him . Then Strong-arm called up his brothers , and when they had embraced their father , they soon broke his chain and set him free .</p>
   <p>We must now return to the Little Old Woman . After her sons had started she gave way to the most bitter grief . While she was in this state , an old witch came up to her , and said she would help her , as she hated the Giant , and wished to kill him . The Old Witch then took the little Old Lady on her broom , and they sailed off through the air , straight to the Giant 's castle .</p>
   <figure>

   </figure>
   <p>Now this old Witch had great power , and at once afflicted the Giant with corns and tender feet . When he awoke from his sleep he was in such pain that he could bear it no longer , so he thought he would go in search of his missing shoe , which , like the other one he had in his castle , was easy and large for his foot . When he came to the spot where the Old Lady and her children lived , he saw his old shoe , and with a laugh that shook the trees , he thrust his foot into it , breaking through the roof that Strong-arm and Peter had put to it . The children , in great alarm , rushed about inside the shoe , and frightened and trembling , scrambled through the door and the slits which the Giant had formerly made for his corns . By this time the witch and the Little Old Lady , as also Strong-arm , his eleven brother and his father , were come up to the spot . Strong-arm and his brothers shot their arrows at him till at last he fell wounded , when Strong-arm went up to him and cut off his head . Then the father and the Little Old Woman and all their children built a new house , and lived happily ever afterwards .</p>

    <head>LITTLE BO-PEEP .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Little Bo-Peep she lost her sheep</l>
     <l n="2">And did n't know where to find them .</l>
     <l n="3">Let them alone , and they 'll come home ,</l>
     <l n="4">And bring their tails behind them ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">[ Illustration : Bo-peep searching . ]</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>So runs the Nursery Rhyme . Little Bo-Peep was a very nice little girl . Her cheeks had a bloom on them like a lovely peach , and her voice sounded like a sweet silver bell .</p>
   <p>But though Little Bo-Peep was as good as she was beautiful , she sometimes met with misfortunes that made her very sad . Once , when she lost her sheep , she was very doleful indeed . And this is how it happened .</p>
   <p>One summer evening , when the sun was setting , Little Bo-Peep , who had to rise very early in the morning , felt tired , and sat down on a bank covered with daisies . Being very weary she soon fell fast asleep . Now the Bell-wether of Bo-Peep 's flock was a most stupid and stubborn fellow . I dare say you know that all the sheep in a flock will follow the Bell-wether , and that he always wears a bell round his neck . It was a great pity , but the Bell-wether of Bo-Peep 's flock was very wild , and was much given to wander far away into the wood , where of course the rest of the sheep would follow him .</p>
   <p>Finding Little Bo-Peep asleep , the tiresome fellow began by standing on his hind legs and making a great bow to his shadow before him on the grass . After this he whirled himself round like a top , shaking his head all the time , and ringing his bell .</p>
   <figure>

   </figure>
   <p>Very soon the rest of the flock began to dance and caper too . And when they had wheeled round their leader for a time , they ran off after him with a bound into the wood . Away they went , till they were quite tired out ; and then they came to a stand-still , staring at their leader with very blank faces . But the Bell-wether looked foolish enough now , and did nothing but shake his head slowly and ring his bell , which seemed to say quite clearly , “ You are lost , you are lost ! ”</p>
   <p>When Little Bo-Peep awoke she found her sheep gone , and hardly knowing what she did , she walked on and on , far into the wood . She met some people with hoes and rakes in their hands , and asked them if they had seen her sheep . But they only laughed at her , and said , No . One man was very cross , and threatened to beat her . At last she came to a stile , on which an old Raven was perched . He looked so wise that Little Bo-Peep asked him whether he had seen a flock of sheep . But he only cried “ Caw , caw , caw ; ” so Bo-Peep ran on again across the fields .</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Bo-peep and Raven .</p>
   </figure>
   <p>She wandered on till night-fall , and being faint with hunger , was very glad to see a light just before her . As she went on , she saw that it shone from a cottage window . But when she came to the door , it looked so dark and dismal that she was afraid to go in , and was just going to run away , when a cross-looking old woman came out , and dragged her into the cottage . She made her sit by the side of her son , who was a very ugly youth with a great red face and red hair .</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Bo-peep and ugly Youth .</p>
   </figure>
   <p>The old woman told him that she had brought Bo-Peep to be his wife , so Bo-Peep , who did not like him at all , ran away while they were asleep . But she did not know where to go , and gave herself up for lost , when she heard something cry , “ tu-whit — tu-whoo , ” in the tree above her . It was a great owl , which began flapping its wings with joy . Bo-Peep was frightened at first , but as the owl seemed very kind , she followed it . It took her to a cottage were there was plenty to eat and drink , and then , to Bo-Peep 's great surprise , it began to speak , and told her this story :—</p>
   <p>“ Know , dear Maiden , ” said the owl , “ that I am the daughter of a King , and was a lovely Princess ; but I was changed into an owl by the old woman at the cottage , because I would not marry her ugly son . But I have heard the fairies say that one day a lovely maiden , who would come into this wood to find her lost sheep , should be the means of my gaining my own form again . You are that pretty maid , and I will take you to a spot where you will find your sheep , but without their tails . The elves will play with them for this night , but in the morning every sheep will have its tail again , except the stupid Bell-wether . You must then wave his tail three times over my head , and I shall resume my shape again . ”</p>
   <p>The owl flew off , and led Bo-Peep into the wood , and said , “ Sleep , maiden , I will watch . ” How long she was asleep she could not tell , but the charmed spot was suddenly lighted up , and she saw the Queen of the Fairies seated on a bank . The Queen said the sheep should be punished for running away . She then saw all her sheep come trooping into the place , and on every sheep there was an Elf , who held in his hand a sheep 's tail .</p>

   </figure>
   <p>After riding them about for some time , and having great fun with them , the mad sport ceased , and each Elf restored the tail to his sheep — all but the Bell-wether 's , which their leader hid in a tree . When Bo-Peep awoke , she saw the owl flapping its wings as if to remind her of her promise ; so she fetched the tail , and waved it three times over its head , when up started the most charming Princess that ever was seen . The princess gave Bo-Peep a beautiful cottage , and her sheep never ran away from their kind mistress again .</p>

     <l n="2">The Little Pig who Went to Market .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>There was once a family of Five Little Pigs , and Mrs . Pig , their mother , loved them all very dearly . Some of these little pigs were very good , and took a great deal of trouble to please her . The eldest pig was so active and useful that he was called Mr . Pig . One day he went to market with his cart full of vegetables , but Rusty , the donkey , began to show his bad temper before he had gone very far on the road . All the coaxing and whipping would not make him move . So Mr . Pig took him out of the shafts , and being very strong , drew the cart to market himself . When he got there , all the other pigs began to laugh . But they did not laugh so loudly when Mr . Pig told them all his struggles on the road . Mr . Pig lost no time in selling his vegetables , and very soon after Rusty came trotting into the market-place , and as he now seemed willing to take his place in the cart , Mr . Pig started for home without delay . When he got there , he told Mrs . Pig his story , and she called him her best and most worthy son .</p>

   <p>This little pig very much wanted to go with his brother , but as he was so mischievous that he could not be trusted far away , his mother made him stay at home , and told him to keep a good fire while she went out to the miller 's to buy some flour . But as soon as he was alone , instead of learning his lessons , he began to tease the poor cat . Then he got the bellows , and cut the leather with a knife , so as to see where the wind came from : and when he could not find this out , he began to cry . After this he broke all his brother 's toys ; he forced the drum-stick through the drum , he tore off the tail from the kite , and then pulled off the horse 's head . And then he went to the cupboard and ate the jam . When Mrs . Pig came home , she sat down by the fire , and being very tired , she soon fell asleep . No sooner had she done so , than this bad little pig got a long handkerchief and tied her in her chair . But soon she awoke and found out all the mischief that he had been doing . She saw at once the damage that he had done to his brother 's playthings . So she quickly brought out her thickest and heaviest birch , and gave this naughty little pig such a beating as he did not forget for a long time .</p>

   <p>The Little Pig who had Roast Beef .</p>
   <p>This little pig was a very good and careful fellow . He gave his mother scarcely any trouble , and always took a pleasure in doing all she bade him . Here you see him sitting down with clean hands and face , to some nice roast beef , while his brother , the idle pig , who is standing on a stool in the corner , with the dunce 's cap on , has none . He sat down and quietly learned his lesson , and asked his mother to hear him repeat it . And this he did so well that Mrs . Pig stroked him on the ears and forehead , and called him a good little pig . After this he asked her to allow him to help her make tea . He brought everything she wanted , and lifted off the kettle from the fire , without spilling a drop either on his toes or the carpet . By-and-bye he went out , after asking his mother 's leave , to play with his hoop . He had not gone far when he saw an old blind pig , who , with his hat in his hand was crying at the loss of his dog ; so he put his hand in his pocket and found a halfpenny which he gave to the poor old pig . It was for such thoughtful conduct as this that his mother often gave this little pig roast beef . We now come to the little pig who had none .</p>

   <p>The Little Pig who had None .</p>
   <p>This was a most obstinate and wilful little pig . His mother had set him to learn his lesson , but no sooner had she gone out into the garden , than he tore his book into pieces . When his mother came back he ran off into the streets to play with other idle little pigs like himself . After this he quarrelled with one of the pigs and got a sound thrashing . Being afraid to go home , he stayed out till it was quite dark and caught a severe cold . So he was taken home and put to bed , and had to take a lot of nasty physic .</p>

   <p>The Little Pig who Cried “ Wee , wee , ” all the Way Home .</p>
   <p>This little pig went fishing . Now he had been told not to go into Farmer Grumpey 's grounds , who did not allow any one to fish in his part of the river . But in spite of what he had been told , this foolish little pig went there . He soon caught a very large fish , and while he was trying to carry it home , Farmer Grumpey came running along with his great whip . He quickly dropped the fish , but the farmer caught him , and as he laid his whip over his back for some time , the little pig ran off , crying , “ Wee , wee , wee , ” all the way home .</p>

    <head>THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK .</head>
     <l n="1">[ Illustration : Mother Goose and family . ]</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Old Mother Goose lived in a cottage with her son Jack . Jack was a very good lad , and although he was not handsome , he was good-tempered and industrious , and this made him better-looking than half the other boys . Old Mother Goose carried a long stick , she wore a high-crowned hat , and high-heeled shoes , and her kerchief was as white as snow . Then there was the Gander that swam in the pond , and the Owl that sat on the wall . So you see they formed a very happy family . But what a fine strong fellow the Gander was ! Whenever Old Mother Goose wanted to take a journey , she would mount upon his broad strong back , and away he would fly and carry her swiftly to any distance .</p>

   <p>Now Old Mother Goose thought her Gander often looked sad and lonely ; so one day she sent Jack to market to buy the finest Goose he could find . It was early in the morning when he started , and his way lay through a wood . He was not afraid of robbers ; so on he went , with his Mother 's great clothes-prop over his shoulder . The fresh morning air caused Jack 's spirits to rise . He left the road , and plunged into the thick of the wood , where he amused himself by leaping with his clothes-prop till he found he had lost himself . After he had made many attempts to find the path again , he heard a scream . He jumped up and ran boldly towards the spot from which the sound came . Through an opening in the trees he saw a young lady trying to get away from a ruffian who wanted to steal her mantle . With one heavy blow of his staff Jack sent the thief howling away , and then went back to the young lady , who was lying on the ground , crying .</p>

   <p>She soon dried her tears when she found that the robber had made off , and thanked Jack for his help . The young lady told Jack that she was the daughter of the Squire , who lived in the great white house on the hill-top . She knew the path out of the wood quite well , and when they reached the border , she said that Jack must come soon to her father 's house , so that he might thank him for his noble conduct .</p>
   <p>When Jack was left alone , he made the best of his way to the market-place . He found little trouble in picking out the best Goose , for when he got there he was very late , and there was but one left . But as it was a prime one , Jack bought it at once , and keeping to the road , made straight for home . At first the Goose objected to be carried ; and then , when she had walked along slowly and gravely for a short time , she tried to fly away ; so Jack seized her in his arms and kept her there till he reached home .</p>

   <p>Old Mother Goose was greatly pleased when she saw what a fine bird Jack had bought ; and the Gander showed more joy than I can describe . And then they all lived very happily for a long time . But Jack would often leave off work to dream of the lovely young lady whom he had rescued in the forest , and soon began to sigh all day long . He neglected the garden , cared no more for the Gander , and scarcely even noticed the beautiful Goose . But one morning , as he was walking by the pond , he saw both the Goose and the Gander making a great noise , as though they were in the utmost glee . He went up to them and was surprised to find on the bank a large golden egg . He ran with it to his mother , who said , “ Go to market , my son ; sell your egg , and you will soon be rich enough to pay a visit to the Squire . ” So to market Jack went , and sold his golden egg ; but the rogue who bought it of him cheated him out of half his due . Then he dressed himself in his finest clothes , and went up to the Squire 's house . Two footmen stood at the door , one looking very stout and saucy , and the other sleepy and stupid .</p>

   <p>When Jack asked to see the Squire , they laughed at him , and made sport of his fine clothes ; but Jack had wit enough to offer them each a guinea , when they at once showed him to the Squire 's room .</p>
   <p>Now the Squire , who was very rich , was also very proud and fat , and scarcely turned his head to notice Jack ; but when he showed him his bag of gold , and asked for his daughter to be his bride , the Squire flew into a rage , and ordered his servants to throw him into the horse-pond . But this was not so easy to do , for Jack was strong and active ; and then the young lady come out and begged her father to release him . This made Jack more deeply in love with her than ever , and he went home determined to win her in spite of all . And well did his wonderful Goose aid him in his design . Almost every morning she would lay him a golden egg , and Jack , grown wiser , would no longer sell them at half their value to the rogue who had before cheated him . So Jack soon grew to be a richer man than the Squire himself . His wealth became known to all the country round , and the Squire at length consented to accept Jack as his son-in-law . Then Old Mother Goose flew away into the woods on the back of her strong Gander , leaving the cottage and the Goose to Jack and his bride , who lived happily ever afterwards .</p>
