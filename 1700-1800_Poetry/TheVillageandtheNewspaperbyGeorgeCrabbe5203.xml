    <docImprint>The Subject proposed — Remarks upon Pastoral Poetry — A Tract of Country near the Coast described — An Impoverished Borough — Smugglers and their Assistants — Rude Manners of the Inhabitants — Ruinous Effects of the High Tide — The Village Life more generally considered : Evils of it — The Youthful Labourer — The Old Man : his Soliloquy — The Parish Workhouse : its Inhabitants — The sick Poor : their Apothecary — The dying Pauper — The Village Priest . The Village Life , and every care that reigns O'er youthful peasants and declining swains ; What labour yields , and what , that labour past , Age , in its hour of languor , finds at last ; What form the real Picture of the Poor , Demand a song — the Muse can give no more . Fled are those times , when , in harmonious strains , The rustic poet praised his native plains : No Shepherds now , in smooth alternate verse , Their country 's beauty or their nymphs rehearse ; Yet still for these we frame the tender strain , Still in our lays fond Corydons complain , And shepherds ’ boys their amorous pains reveal , The only pains , alas ! they never feel . On Mincio 's banks , in Caesar 's bounteous reign , If Tityrus found the Golden Age again , Must sleepy bards the nattering dream prolong , Mechanic echoes of the Mantuan song ? From Truth and Nature shall we widely stray , Where Virgil , not where Fancy , leads the way ? Yes , thus the Muses sing of happy swains , Because the Muses never knew their pains : They boast their peasant 's pipes ; but peasants now Resign their pipes and plod behind the plough ; And few , amid the rural tribe , have time To number syllables and play with rhyme ; Save honest DUCK , what son of verse could share The poet 's rapture and the peasant 's care ? Or the great labours of the field degrade , With the new peril of a poorer trade ? From this chief cause these idle praises spring , That themes so easy few forbear to sing ; For no deep thought the trifling subjects ask ; To sing of shepherds is an easy task : The happy youth assumes the common strain , A nymph his mistress , and himself a swain ; With no sad scenes he clouds his tuneful prayer , But all , to look like her , is painted fair . I grant indeed that fields and flocks have charms For him that grazes or for him that farms ; But when amid such pleasing scenes I trace The poor laborious natives of the place , And see the mid-day sun , with fervid ray , On their bare heads and dewy temples play ; While some , with feebler heads and fainter hearts , Deplore their fortune , yet sustain their parts Then shall I dare these real ills to hide In tinsel trappings of poetic pride ? No ; cast by Fortune on a frowning coast , Which neither groves nor happy valleys boast ; Where other cares than those the Muse relates , And other shepherds dwell with other mates ; By such examples taught , I paint the Cot , As Truth will paint it , and as Bards will not : Nor you , ye Poor , of letter 'd scorn complain , To you the smoothest song is smooth in vain ; O'ercome by labour , and bow 'd down by time , Feel you the barren flattery of a rhyme ? Can poets soothe you , when you pine for bread , By winding myrtles round your ruin 'd shed ? Can their light tales your weighty griefs o'erpower , Or glad with airy mirth the toilsome hour ? Lo ! where the heath , with withering brake grown o'er , Lends the light turf that warms the neighbouring poor ; From thence a length of burning sand appears , Where the thin harvest waves its wither 'd ears ; Rank weeds , that every art and care defy , Reign o'er the land , and rob the blighted rye . There thistles stretch their prickly arms afar , And to the ragged infant threaten war ; There poppies nodding , mock the hope of toil , There the blue bugloss paints the sterile soil ; Hardy and high , above the slender sheaf , The slimy mallow waves her silky leaf ; O'er the young shoot the charlock throws a shade , And clasping tares cling round the sickly blade . With mingled tints the rocky coasts abound , And a sad splendour vainly shines around . So looks the nymph whom wretched arts adorn , Betray 'd by man , then left for man to scorn ; Whose cheek in vain assumes the mimic rose , While her sad eyes the troubled breast disclose ; Whose outward splendour is but folly 's dress , Exposing most , when most it gilds distress . Here joyless roam a wild amphibious race , With sullen woe display 'd in every face ; Who , far from civil arts and social fly , And scowl at strangers with suspicious eye . Here too the lawless merchant of the main Draws from his plough th ’ intoxicated swain ; Want only claim 'd the labour of the day , But vice now steals his nightly rest away . Where are the swains , who , daily labour done , With rural games play 'd down the setting sun ; Who struck with matchless force the bounding ball , Or made the pond'rous quoit obliquely fall ; While some huge Ajax , terrible and strong , Engaged some artful stripling of the throng . And fell beneath him , foil 'd , while far around Hoarse triumph rose , and rocks return 'd the sound ? Where now are these ?— Beneath yon cliff they stand , To show the freighted pinnace where to land ; To load the ready steed with guilty haste , To fly in terror o'er the pathless waste , Or , when detected , in their straggling course , To foil their foes by cunning or by force ; Or , yielding part ( which equal knaves demand ) , To gain a lawless passport through the land . Here , wand'ring long , amid these frowning fields , I sought the simple life that Nature yields ; Rapine and Wrong and Fear usurp 'd her place , And a bold , artful , surly , savage race ; Who , only skill 'd to take the finny tribe , The yearly dinner , or septennial bribe , Wait on the shore , and , as the waves run high , On the tost vessel bend their eager eye , Which to their coast directs its vent'rous way ; Theirs or the ocean 's miserable prey . As on their neighbouring beach yon swallows stand , And wait for favouring winds to leave the land ; While still for flight the ready wing is spread : So waited I the favouring hour , and fled ; Fled from these shores where guilt and famine reign , And cried , Ah ! hapless they who still remain ; Who still remain to hear the ocean roar , Whose greedy waves devour the lessening shore ; Till some fierce tide , with more imperious sway , Sweeps the low hut and all it holds away ; When the sad tenant weeps from door to door ; And begs a poor protection from the poor ! But these are scenes where Nature 's niggard hand Gave a spare portion to the famish 'd land ; Hers is the fault , if here mankind complain Of fruitless toil and labour spent in vain ; But yet in other scenes more fair in view , When Plenty smiles — alas ! she smiles for few -  And those who taste not , yet behold her store , Are as the slaves that dig the golden ore -  The wealth around them makes them doubly poor . Or will you deem them amply paid in health , Labour 's fair child , that languishes with wealth ? Go then ! and see them rising with the sun , Through a long course of daily toil to run ; See them beneath the Dog-star 's raging heat , When the knees tremble and the temples beat ; Behold them , leaning on their scythes , look o'er The labour past , and toils to come explore ; See them alternate suns and showers engage , And hoard up aches and anguish for their age ; Through fens and marshy moors their steps pursue , When their warm pores imbibe the evening dew ; Then own that labour may as fatal be To these thy slaves , as thine excess to thee . Amid this tribe too oft a manly pride Strives in strong toil the fainting heart to hide ; There may you see the youth of slender frame Contend with weakness , weariness , and shame ; Yet , urged along , and proudly loth to yield , He strives to join his fellows of the field : Till long-contending nature droops at last , Declining health rejects his poor repast , His cheerless spouse the coming danger sees , And mutual murmurs urge the slow disease . Yet grant them health , ‘ tis not for us to tell , Though the head droops not , that the heart is well ; Or will you praise that homely , healthy fare , Plenteous and plain , that happy peasants share ? Oh ! trifle not with wants you cannot feel , Nor mock the misery of a stinted meal ; Homely , not wholesome , plain , not plenteous , such As you who praise would never deign to touch . Ye gentle souls , who dream of rural ease , Whom the smooth stream and smoother sonnet please ; Go ! if the peaceful cot your praises share , Go look within , and ask if peace be there ; If peace be his , that drooping weary sire ; Or theirs , that offspring round their feeble fire ; Or hers , that matron pale , whose trembling hand Turns on the wretched hearth th ’ expiring brand ! Nor yet can Time itself obtain for these Life 's latest comforts , due respect and ease ; For yonder see that hoary swain , whose age Can with no cares except its own engage ; Who , propt on that rude staff , looks up to see The bare arms broken from the withering tree , On which , a boy , he climb 'd the loftiest bough , Then his first joy , but his sad emblem now . He once was chief in all the rustic trade ; His steady hand the straightest furrow made ; Full many a prize he won , and still is proud To find the triumphs of his youth allow 'd ; A transient pleasure sparkles in his eyes , He hears and smiles , then thinks again and sighs : For now he journeys to his grave in pain ; The rich disdain him ; nay the poor disdain : Alternate masters now their slave command , Urge the weak efforts of his feeble hand , And , when his age attempts its task in vain , With ruthless taunts , of lazy poor complain . Oft may you see him , when he tends the sheep , His winter charge , beneath the hillock weep ; Oft hear him murmur to the winds that blow O'er his white locks and bury them in snow , When , rous 'd by rage and muttering in the morn , He mends the broken hedge with icy thorn : -  “ Why do I live , when I desire to be At once from life and life 's long labour free ? Like leaves in spring , the young are blown away , Without the sorrows of a slow decay ; I , like yon withered leaf remain behind , Nipt by the frost , and shivering in the wind ; There it abides till younger buds come on As I , now all my fellow-swains are gone , Then from the rising generation thrust , It falls , like me , unnoticed to the dust . “ These fruitful fields , these numerous flocks I see , Are others ’ gain , but killing cares to me ; To me the children of my youth are lords , Cool in their looks , but hasty in their words : Wants of their own demand their care ; and who Feels his own want and succours others too ? A lonely , wretched man , in pain I go , None need my help , and none relieve my woe ; Then let my bones beneath the turf be laid , And men forget the wretch they would not aid . ” Thus groan the old , till by disease oppress 'd , They taste a final woe , and then they rest . Theirs is yon House that holds the parish poor , Whose walls of mud scarce bear the broken door ; There , where the putrid vapours , flagging , play , And the dull wheel hums doleful through the day ; -  There children dwell who know no parents ’ care ; Parents , who know no children 's love , dwell there ! Heart-broken matrons on their joyless bed , Forsaken wives , and mothers never wed ; Dejected widows with unheeded tears , And crippled age with more than childhood fears ; The lame , the blind , and , far the happiest they ! The moping idiot , and the madman gay . Here too the sick their final doom receive , Here brought , amid the scenes of grief , to grieve , Where the loud groans from some sad chamber flow , Mixt with the clamours of the crowd below ; Here , sorrowing , they each kindred sorrow scan , And the cold charities of man to man : Whose laws indeed for ruin 'd age provide , And strong compulsion plucks the scrap from pride ; But still that scrap is bought with many a sigh , And pride embitters what it can n't deny . Say , ye , opprest by some fantastic woes , Some jarring nerve that baffles your repose ; Who press the downy couch , while slaves advance With timid eye to read the distant glance ; Who with sad prayers the weary doctor tease , To name the nameless ever new disease ; Who with mock patience dire complaints endure , Which real pain and that alone can cure ; How would ye bear in real pain to lie , Despised , neglected , left alone to die ? How would ye bear to draw your latest breath Where all that 's wretched paves the way for death ? Such is that room which one rude beam divides , And naked rafters form the sloping sides ; Where the vile bands that bind the thatch are seen , And lath and mud are all that lie between ; Save one dull pane , that , coarsely patch 'd , gives way To the rude tempest , yet excludes the day : Here , on a matted flock , with dust o'erspread , The drooping wretch reclines his languid head ; For him no hand the cordial cup applies , Or wipes the tear that stagnates in his eyes ; No friends with soft discourse his pain beguile , Or promise hope , till sickness wears a smile . But soon a loud and hasty summons calls , Shakes the thin roof , and echoes round the walls ; Anon , a figure enters , quaintly neat , All pride and business , bustle and conceit ; With looks unalter 'd by these scenes of woe , With speed that , entering , speaks his haste to go , He bids the gazing throng around him fly , And carries fate and physic in his eye : A potent quack , long versed in human ills , Who first insults the victim whom he kills ; Whose murd'rous hand a drowsy Bench protect , And whose most tender mercy is neglect . Paid by the parish for attendance here , He wears contempt upon his sapient sneer ; In haste he seeks the bed where Misery lies , Impatience mark 'd in his averted eyes ; And , some habitual queries hurried o'er , Without reply , he rushes on the door : His drooping patient , long inured to pain , And long unheeded , knows remonstrance vain ; He ceases now the feeble help to crave Of man ; and silent sinks into the grave . But ere his death some pious doubts arise , Some simple fears , which “ bold bad ” men despise ; Fain would he ask the parish priest to prove His title certain to the joys above : For this he sends the murmuring nurse , who calls The holy stranger to these dismal walls : And doth not he , the pious man , appear , He , “ passing rich , with forty pounds a year ? ” Ah ! no ; a shepherd of a different stock , And far unlike him , feeds this little flock : A jovial youth , who thinks his Sunday 's task As much as God or man can fairly ask ; The rest he gives to loves and labours light , To fields the morning , and to feasts the night ; None better skill 'd the noisy pack to guide , To urge their chase , to cheer them or to chide ; A sportsman keen , he shoots through half the day , And , skill 'd at whist , devotes the night to play : Then , while such honours bloom around his head , Shall he sit sadly by the sick man 's bed , To raise the hope he feels not , or with zeal To combat fears that e'en the pious , feel ? Now once again the gloomy scene explore , Less gloomy now ; the bitter hour is o'er , The man of many sorrows sighs no more . - Up yonder hill , behold how sadly slow The bier moves winding from the vale below : There lie the happy dead , from trouble free , And the glad parish pays the frugal fee : No more , O Death ! thy victim starts to hear Churchwarden stern , or kingly overseer ; No more the farmer claims his humble bow , Thou art his lord , the best of tyrants thou ! Now to the church behold the mourners come , Sedately torpid and devoutly dumb ; The village children now their games suspend , To see the bier that bears their ancient friend : For he was one in all their idle sport , And like a monarch ruled their little court ; The pliant bow he form 'd , the flying ball , The bat , the wicket , were his labours all ; Him now they follow to his grave , and stand , Silent and sad , and gazing hand in hand ; While bending low , their eager eyes explore The mingled relics of the parish poor . The bell tolls late , the moping owl flies round , Fear marks the flight and magnifies the sound ; The busy priest , detain 'd by weightier care , Defers his duty till the day of prayer ; And , waiting long , the crowd retire distrest , To think a poor man 's bones should lie unblest . BOOK II — THE ARGUMENT . There are found , amid the Evils of a laborious Life , some Views of Tranquillity and Happiness — The Repose and Pleasure of a Summer Sabbath : interrupted by Intoxication and Dispute — Village Detraction — Complaints of the ‘ Squire — The Evening Riots — Justice — Reasons for this unpleasant View of Rustic Life : the Effect it should have upon the Lower Classes ; and the Higher — These last have their peculiar Distresses : Exemplified in the Life and heroic Death of Lord Robert Manners — Concluding Address to His Grace the Duke of Rutland .</docImprint>
    <docTitle><titlePart>No longer truth , though shown in verse , disdain , But own the Village Life a life of pain : I too must yield , that oft amid those woes Are gleams of transient mirth and hours of sweet repose , Such as you find on yonder sportive Green , The ‘ squire 's tall gate and churchway-walk between ; Where loitering stray a little tribe of friends , On a fair Sunday when the sermon ends : Then rural beaux their best attire put on , To win their nymphs , as other nymphs are won : While those long wed go plain , and by degrees , Like other husbands , quit their care to please . Some of the sermon talk , a sober crowd , And loudly praise , if it were preach 'd aloud ; Some on the labours of the week look round , Feel their own worth , and think their toil renown 'd ; While some , whose hopes to no renown extend , Are only pleased to find their labours end . Thus , as their hours glide on , with pleasure fraught Their careful masters brood the painful thought ; Much in their mind they murmur and lament , That one fair day should be so idly spent ; And think that Heaven deals hard , to tithe their store And tax their time for preachers and the poor . Yet still , ye humbler friends , enjoy your hour , This is your portion , yet unclaim 'd of power ; This is Heaven 's gift to weary men oppress 'd , And seems the type of their expected rest : But yours , alas ! are joys that soon decay ; Frail joys , begun and ended with the day ; Or yet , while day permits those joys to reign , The village vices drive them from the plain . See the stout churl , in drunken fury great , Strike the bare bosom of his teeming mate ! His naked vices , rude and unrefined , Exert their open empire o'er the mind ; But can we less the senseless rage despise , Because the savage acts without disguise ? Yet here Disguise , the city 's vice , is seen , And Slander steals along and taints the Green : At her approach domestic peace is gone , Domestic broils at her approach come on ; She to the wife the husband 's crime conveys , She tells the husband when his consort strays ; Her busy tongue , through all the little state , Diffuses doubt , suspicion , and debate ; Peace , tim'rous goddess ! quits her old domain , In sentiment and song content to reign . Nor are the nymphs that breathe the rural air So fair as Cynthia 's , nor so chaste as fair : These to the town afford each fresher face , And the clown 's trull receives the peer 's embrace ; From whom , should chance again convey her down , The peer 's disease in turn attacks the clown . Here too the ‘ squire , or ‘ squire-like farmer , talk , How round their regions nightly pilferers walk ; How from their ponds the fish are borne , and all The rip'ning treasures from their lofty wall ; How meaner rivals in their sports delight , Just right enough to claim a doubtful right ; Who take a licence round their fields to stray , A mongrel race ! the poachers of the day . And hark ! the riots of the Green begin , That sprang at first from yonder noisy inn ; What time the weekly pay was vanish 'd all , And the slow hostess scored the threat'ning wall ; What time they ask 'd , their friendly feast to close , A final cup , and that will make them foes ; When blows ensue that break the arm of toil , And rustic battle ends the boobies ’ broil . Save when to yonder Hall they bend their way , Where the grave Justice ends the grievous fray ; He who recites , to keep the poor in awe , The law 's vast volume — for he knows the law : -  To him with anger or with shame repair The injured peasant and deluded fair . Lo ! at his throne the silent nymph appears , Frail by her shape , but modest in her tears ; And while she stands abash 'd , with conscious eye , Some favourite female of her judge glides by , Who views with scornful glance the strumpet 's fate , And thanks the stars that made her keeper great : Near her the swain , about to bear for life One certain evil , doubts ‘ twixt war and wife ; But , while the faltering damsel takes her oath , Consents to wed , and so secures them both . Yet why , you ask , these humble crimes relate , Why make the Poor as guilty as the Great ? To show the great , those mightier sons of pride , How near in vice the lowest are allied ; Such are their natures and their passions such , But these disguise too little , those too much : So shall the man of power and pleasure see In his own slave as vile a wretch as he ; In his luxurious lord the servant find His own low pleasures and degenerate mind : And each in all the kindred vices trace , Of a poor , blind , bewilder 'd erring race , Who , a short time in varied fortune past , Die , and are equal in the dust at last . And you , ye Poor , who still lament your fate , Forbear to envy those you call the Great ; And know , amid those blessings they possess , They are , like you , the victims of distress ; While Sloth , with many a pang torments her slave , Fear waits on guilt , and Danger shakes the brave . Oh ! if in life one noble chief appears , Great in his name , while blooming in his years ; Born to enjoy whate'er delights mankind , And yet to all you feel or fear resign 'd ; Who gave up joys and hopes to you unknown , For pains and dangers greater than your own : If such there be , then let your murmurs cease , Think , think of him , and take your lot in peace . And such there was :— Oh ! grief , that checks our pride , Weeping we say there was , for MANNERS { 1 } died : Beloved of Heaven , these humble lines forgive That sing of Thee , and thus aspire to live . As the tall oak , whose vigorous branches form An ample shade , and brave the wildest storm , High o'er the subject wood is seen to grow , The guard and glory of the trees below ; Till on its head the fiery bolt descends , And o'er the plain the shattered trunk extends ; Yet then it lies , all wond'rous as before , And still the glory , though the guard no more : So THOU , when every virtue , every grace , Rose in thy soul , or shone within thy face ; When , though the son of GRANBY , thou wert known Less by thy father 's glory than thy own ; When Honour loved and gave thee every charm , Fire to thy eye and vigour to thy arm ; Then from our lofty hopes and longing eyes , Fate and thy virtues call 'd thee to the skies ; Yet still we wonder at thy tow'ring fame , And , losing thee , still dwell upon thy name . Oh ! ever honour 'd , ever valued ! say , What verse can praise thee , or what work repay ? Yet verse ( in all we can ) thy worth repays , Nor trusts the tardy zeal of future days : -  Honours for thee thy country shall prepare , Thee in their hearts , the good , the brave shall bear ; To deeds like thine shall noblest chiefs aspire , The Muse shall mourn thee , and the world admire . In future times , when smit with Glory 's charms , The untried youth first quits a father 's arms ; -  “ Oh ! be like him , ” the weeping sire shall say ; “ Like MANNERS walk , who walk 'd in Honour 's way ; In danger foremost , yet in death sedate , Oh ! be like him in all things , but his fate ! ” If for that fate such public tears be shed , That Victory seems to die now THOU art dead ; How shall a friend his nearer hope resign , That friend a brother , and whose soul was thine ? By what bold lines shall we his grief express , Or by what soothing numbers make it less ? ‘ Tis not , I know , the chiming of a song , Nor all the powers that to the Muse belong , Words aptly cull 'd , and meaning well express 'd , Can calm the sorrows of a wounded breast ; But Virtue , soother of the fiercest pains , Shall heal that bosom , RUTLAND , where she reigns . Yet hard the task to heal the bleeding heart , To bid the still-recurring thoughts depart , Tame the fierce grief and stem the rising sigh , And curb rebellious passion , with reply ; Calmly to dwell on all that pleased before , And yet to know that all shall please no more ; -  Oh ! glorious labour of the soul , to save Her captive powers , and bravely mourn the brave . To such these thoughts will lasting comfort give -  Life is not measured by the time we live : ‘ Tis not an even course of threescore years , -  A life of narrow views and paltry fears , Gray hairs and wrinkles , and the cares they bring , That take from Death the terrors or the sting ; But ‘ tis the gen'rous spirit , mounting high Above the world , that native of the sky ; The noble spirit , that , in dangers brave Calmly looks on , or looks beyond the grave : -  Such MANNERS was , so he resign 'd his breath , If in a glorious , then a timely death . Cease , then , that grief , and let those tears subside ; If Passion rule us , be that passion pride ; If Reason , reason bids us strive to raise Our fallen hearts , and be like him we praise ; Or if Affection still the soul subdue , Bring all his virtues , all his worth in view , And let Affection find its comfort too : For how can Grief so deeply wound the heart , When Admiration claims so large a part ? Grief is a foe — expel him then thy soul ; Let nobler thoughts the nearer views control ! Oh ! make the age to come thy better care , See other RUTLANDS , other GRANBYS there ! And , as thy thoughts through streaming ages glide , See other heroes die as MANNERS died : And from their fate , thy race shall nobler grow , As trees shoot upwards that are pruned below ; Or as old Thames , borne down with decent pride , Sees his young streams run warbling at his side ; Though some , by art cut off , no longer run , And some are lost beneath the summer sun -  Yet the pure stream moves on , and , as it moves , Its power increases and its use improves ; While plenty round its spacious waves bestow , Still it flows on , and shall for ever flow .

    <docImprint>A time like this , a busy , bustling time , Suits ill with writers , very ill with rhyme : Unheard we sing , when party-rage runs strong , And mightier madness checks the flowing song : Or , should we force the peaceful Muse to wield Her feeble arms amid the furious field , Where party-pens a wordy war maintain , Poor is her anger , and her friendship vain ; And oft the foes who feel her sting , combine , Till serious vengeance pays an idle line : For party-poets are like wasps , who dart Death to themselves , and to their foes but smart . Hard then our fate : if general themes we choose , Neglect awaits the song , and chills the Muse ; Or should we sing the subject of the day , To-morrow 's wonder puffs our praise away . More blest the bards of that poetic time , When all found readers who could find a rhyme ; Green grew the bays on every teeming head , And Cibber was enthroned , and Settle read . Sing , drooping Muse , the cause of thy decline ; Why reign no more the once-triumphant Nine ? Alas ! new charms the wavering many gain , And rival sheets the reader 's eye detain ; A daily swarm , that banish every Muse , Come flying forth , and mortals call them NEWS : For these , unread , the noblest volumes lie ; For these , in sheets unsoil 'd , the Muses die ; Unbought , unblest , the virgin copies wait In vain for fame , and sink , unseen , to fate . Since , then , the Town forsakes us for our foes , The smoothest numbers for the harshest prose ; Let us , with generous scorn , the taste deride , And sing our rivals with a rival 's pride . Ye gentle poets , who so oft complain That foul neglect is all your labours gain ; That pity only checks your growing spite To erring man , and prompts you still to write ; That your choice works on humble stalls are laid , Or vainly grace the windows of the trade ; Be ye my friends , if friendship e'er can warm Those rival bosoms whom the Muses charm ; Think of the common cause wherein we go , Like gallant Greeks against the Trojan foe ; Nor let one peevish chief his leader blame , Till , crown 'd with conquest , we regain our fame ; And let us join our forces to subdue This bold assuming but successful crew . I sing of NEWS , and all those vapid sheets The rattling hawker vends through gaping streets ; Whate'er their name , whate'er the time they fly , Damp from the press , to charm the reader 's eye : For soon as Morning dawns with roseate hue , The HERALD of the morn arises too ; POST after POST succeeds , and , all day long , GAZETTES and LEDGERS swarm , a noisy throng . When evening comes , she comes with all her train ; Of LEDGERS , CHRONICLES , and POSTS again . Like bats , appearing when the sun goes down , From holes obscure and corners of the town . Of all these triflers , all like these , I write ; Oh ! like my subject could my song delight , The crowd at Lloyd 's one poet 's name should raise , And all the Alley echo to his praise . In shoals the hours their constant numbers bring , Like insects waking to th ’ advancing spring ; Which take their rise from grubs obscene that lie In shallow pools , or thence ascend the sky : Such are these base ephemeras , so born To die before the next revolving morn . Yet thus they differ : insect-tribes are lost In the first visit of a winters frost ; While these remain , a base but constant breed , Whose swarming sons their short-lived sires succeed ; No changing season makes their number less , Nor Sunday shines a sabbath on the press ! Then lo ! the sainted MONITOR is born , Whose pious face some sacred texts adorn : As artful sinners cloak the secret sin , To veil with seeming grace the guile within ; So moral Essays on his front appear , But all is carnal business in the rear ; The fresh-coin 'd lie , the secret whisper 'd last , And all the gleanings of the six days past . With these retired through half the Sabbath-day , The<settlement>London</settlement>lounger yawns his hours away : Not so , my little flock ! your preacher fly , Nor waste the time no worldly wealth can buy ; But let the decent maid and sober clown Pray for these idlers of the sinful town : This day , at least , on nobler themes bestow , Nor give to WOODFALL , or the world below . But , Sunday past , what numbers flourish then , What wondrous labours of the press and pen ; Diurnal most , some thrice each week affords , Some only once ,— O avarice of words ! When thousand starving minds such manna seek , To drop the precious food but once a week . Endless it were to sing the powers of all , Their names , their numbers ; how they rise and fall : Like baneful herbs the gazer 's eye they seize , Rush to the head , and poison where they please : Like idle flies , a busy , buzzing train , They drop their maggots in the trifler 's brain : That genia soil receives the fruitful store , And there they grow , and breed a thousand more . Now be their arts display 'd , how first they choose A cause and party , as the bard his Muse ; Inspired by these , with clamorous zeal they cry , And through the town their dreams and omens fly ; So the Sibylline leaves were blown about , Disjointed scraps of fate involved in doubt ; So idle dreams , the journals of the night , Are right and wrong by turns , and mingle wrong with right. -  Some champions for the rights that prop the crown , Some sturdy patriots , sworn to pull them down ; Some neutral powers , with secret forces fraught , Wishing for war , but willing to be bought : While some to every side and party go , Shift every friend , and join with every foe ; Like sturdy rogues in privateers , they strike This side and that , the foes of both alike ; A traitor-crew , who thrive in troubled times , Fear 'd for their force , and courted for their crimes . Chief to the prosperous side the numbers sail , Fickle and false , they veer with every gale ; As birds that migrate from a freezing shore In search of warmer climes , come skimming o'er , Some bold adventurers first prepare to try The doubtful sunshine of the distant sky ; But soon the growing Summer 's certain sun Wins more and more , till all at last are won : So , on the early prospect of disgrace , Fly in vast troops this apprehensive race ; Instinctive tribes ! their failing food they dread , And buy , with timely change , their future bread . Such are our guides ; how many a peaceful head , Born to be still , have they to wrangling led ! How many an honest zealot stol'n from trade , And factious tools of pious pastors made ! With clews like these they thread the maze of state , These oracles explore , to learn our fate ; Pleased with the guides who can so well deceive , Who cannot lie so fast as they believe . Oft lend I , loth , to some sage friend an ear , ( For we who will not speak are doom 'd to hear ) ; While he , bewilder 'd , tells his anxious thought , Infectious fear from tainted scribblers caught , Or idiot hope ; for each his mind assails , As LLOYD 'S court-light or STOCKDALE 'S gloom prevails . Yet stand I patient while but one declaims , Or gives dull comments on the speech he maims : But oh ! ye Muses , keep your votary 's feet From tavern-haunts where politicians meet ; Where rector , doctor , and attorney pause , First on each parish , then each public cause : Indited roads , and rates that still increase ; The murmuring poor , who will not fast in peace ; Election zeal and friendship , since declined ; A tax commuted , or a tithe in kind ; The Dutch and Germans kindling into strife ; Dull port and poachers vile ; the serious ills of life . Here comes the neighbouring Justice , pleased to guide His little club , and in the chair preside . In private business his commands prevail , On public themes his reasoning turns the scale ; Assenting silence soothes his happy ear , And , in or out , his party triumphs here . Nor here th ’ infectious rage for party stops , But flits along from palaces to shops ; Our weekly journals o'er the land abound , And spread their plague and influenzas round ; The village , too , the peaceful , pleasant plain , Breeds the Whig farmer and the Tory swain ; Brookes ’ and St Alban 's boasts not , but , instead , Stares the Red Ram , and swings the Rodney 's Head : -  Hither , with all a patriot 's care , comes he Who owns the little hut that makes him free ; Whose yearly forty shillings buy the smile Of mightier men , and never waste the while ; Who feels his freehold 's worth , and looks elate , A little prop and pillar of the state . Here he delights the weekly news to con , And mingle comments as he blunders on ; To swallow all their varying authors teach , To spell a title , and confound a speech : Till with a muddled mind he quits the news , And claims his nation 's licence to abuse ; Then joins the cry , “ That all the courtly race Are venal candidates for power and place ; ” Yet feels some joy , amid the general vice , That his own vote will bring its wonted price . These are the ills the teeming Press supplies , The pois'nous springs from learning 's fountain rise ; Not there the wise alone their entrance find , Imparting useful light to mortals blind ; But , blind themselves , these erring guides hold out Alluring lights to lead us far about ; Screen 'd by such means , here Scandal whets her quill , Here Slander shoots unseen , whene'er she will ; Here Fraud and Falsehood labour to deceive , And Folly aids them both , impatient to believe . Such , sons of Britain ! are the guides ye trust ; So wise their counsel , their reports so just ! -  Yet , though we cannot call their morals pure , Their judgment nice , or their decisions sure ; Merit they have to mightier works unknown , A style , a manner , and a fate their own . We , who for longer fame with labour strive , Are pain 'd to keep our sickly works alive ; Studious we toil , with patient care refine , Nor let our love protect one languid line . Severe ourselves , at last our works appear , When , ah ! we find our readers more severe ; For , after all our care and pains , how few Acquire applause , or keep it if they do ! Not so these sheets , ordain 'd to happier fate , Praised through their day , and but that day their date ; Their careless authors only strive to join As many words as make an even line ; As many lines as fill a row complete ; As many rows as furnish up a sheet : From side to side , with ready types they run , The measure 's ended , and the work is done ; Oh , born with ease , how envied and how blest ! Your fate to-day and your to-morrow 's rest , To you all readers turn , and they can look Pleased on a paper , who abhor a book ; Those who ne'er deign 'd their Bible to peruse , Would think it hard to be denied their News ; Sinners and saints , the wisest with the weak , Here mingle tastes , and one amusement seek ; This , like the public inn , provides a treat , Where each promiscuous guest sits down to eat ; And such this mental food , as we may call Something to all men , and to some men all . Next , in what rare production shall we trace Such various subjects in so small a space ? As the first ship upon the waters bore Incongruous kinds who never met before ; Or as some curious virtuoso joins In one small room , moths , minerals , and coins , Birds , beasts , and fishes ; nor refuses place To serpents , toads , and all the reptile race ; So here compress 'd within a single sheet , Great things and small , the mean and mighty meet . ‘ Tis this which makes all Europe 's business known , Yet here a private man may place his own : And , where he reads of Lords and Commons , he May tell their honours that he sells rappee . Add next th ’ amusement which the motley page Affords to either sex and every age : Lo ! where it comes before the cheerful fire , -  Damps from the press in smoky curls aspire ( As from the earth the sun exhales the dew ) , Ere we can read the wonders that ensue : Then eager every eye surveys the part That brings its favourite subject to the heart ; Grave politicians look for facts alone , And gravely add conjectures of their own : The sprightly nymph , who never broke her rest For tottering crowns or mighty lands oppress 'd , Finds broils and battles , but neglects them all For songs and suits , a birth-day , or a ball : The keen warm man o'erlooks each idle tale For “ Monies wanted , ” and “ Estates on Sale ; ” While some with equal minds to all attend , Pleased with each part , and grieved to find an end . So charm the news ; but we who , far from town , Wait till the postman brings the packet down , Once in the week , a vacant day behold , And stay for tidings , till they 're three days old : That day arrives ; no welcome post appears , But the dull morn a sullen aspect wears : We meet , but ah ! without our wonted smile , To talk of headaches , and complain of bile ; Sullen we ponder o'er a dull repast , Nor feast the body while the mind must fast . A master passion is the love of news , Not music so commands , nor so the Muse : Give poets claret , they grow idle soon ; Feed the musician and he 's out of tune ; But the sick mind , of this disease possess 'd , Flies from all cure , and sickens when at rest . Now sing , my Muse , what various parts compose These rival sheets of politics and prose . First , from each brother 's hoard a part they draw , A mutual theft that never feared a law ; Whate'er they gain , to each man 's portion fall , And read it once , you read it through them all : For this their runners ramble day and night , To drag each lurking deed to open light ; For daily bread the dirty trade they ply , Coin their fresh tales , and live upon the lie : Like bees for honey , forth for news they spring , -  Industrious creatures ! ever on the wing ; Home to their several cells they bear the store , Cull 'd of all kinds , then roam abroad for more . No anxious virgin flies to “ fair Tweed-side ; ” No injured husband mourns his faithless bride ; No duel dooms the fiery youth to bleed ; But through the town transpires each vent'rous deed . Should some fair frail one drive her prancing pair Where rival peers contend to please the fair ; When , with new force , she aids her conquering eyes , And beauty decks , with all that beauty buys : Quickly we learn whose heart her influence feels , Whose acres melt before her glowing wheels . To these a thousand idle themes succeed , Deeds of all kinds , and comments to each deed . Here stocks , the state barometers , we view , That rise or fall by causes known to few ; Promotion 's ladder who goes up or down ; Who wed , or who seduced , amuse the town ; What new-born heir has made his father blest ; What heir exults , his father now at rest ; That ample list the Tyburn-herald gives , And each known knave , who still for Tyburn lives . So grows the work , and now the printer tries His powers no more , but leans on his allies . When lo ! the advertising tribe succeed , Pay to be read , yet find but few will read ; And chief th ’ illustrious race , whose drops and pills Have patent powers to vanquish human ills : These , with their cures , a constant aid remain , To bless the pale composer 's fertile brain ; Fertile it is , but still the noblest soil Requires some pause , some intervals from toil ; And they at least a certain ease obtain From Katterfelto 's skill , and Graham 's glowing strain . I too must aid , and pay to see my name Hung in these dirty avenues to fame ; Nor pay in vain , if aught the Muse has seen , And sung , could make these avenues more clean ; Could stop one slander ere it found its way , And give to public scorn its helpless prey . By the same aid , the Stage invites her friends , And kindly tells the banquet she intends ; Thither from real life the many run , With Siddons weep , or laugh with Abingdon ; Pleased in fictitious joy or grief , to see The mimic passion with their own agree ; To steal a few enchanted hours away From self , and drop the curtain on the day . But who can steal from self that wretched wight Whose darling work is tried some fatal night ? Most wretched man ! when , bane to every bliss , He hears the serpent-critic 's rising hiss ; Then groans succeed ; nor traitors on the wheel Can feel like him , or have such pangs to feel . Nor end they here : next day he reads his fall In every paper ; critics are they all : He sees his branded name with wild affright , And hears again the cat-calls of the night . Such help the STAGE affords : a larger space Is fill 'd by PUFFS and all the puffing race . Physic had once alone the lofty style , The well-known boast , that ceased to raise a smile : Now all the province of that tribe invade , And we abound in quacks of every trade . The simple barber , once an honest name , Cervantes founded , Fielding raised his fame : Barber no more — a gay perfumer comes , On whose soft cheek his own cosmetic blooms ; Here he appears , each simple mind to move , And advertises beauty , grace , and love . “ Come , faded belles , who would your youth renew , And learn the wonders of Olympian dew ; Restore the roses that begin to faint , Nor think celestial washes vulgar paint ; Your former features , airs , and arts assume , Circassian virtues , with Circassian bloom . Come , battered beaux , whose locks are turned to gray , And crop Discretion 's lying badge away ; Read where they vend these smart engaging things , These flaxen frontlets with elastic springs ; No female eye the fair deception sees , Not Nature 's self so natural as these . ” Such are their arts , but not confined to them , The muse impartial most her sons condemn : For they , degenerate ! join the venal throng , And puff a lazy Pegasus along : More guilty these , by Nature less design 'd For little arts that suit the vulgar kind . That barbers ’ boys , who would to trade advance , Wish us to call them smart Friseurs from<country>France</country>: That he who builds a chop-house , on his door Paints “ The true old original Blue Boar ! ” - These are the arts by which a thousand live , Where Truth may smile , and Justice may forgive : -  But when , amidst this rabble rout , we find A puffing poet to his honour blind ; Who slily drops quotations all about Packet or post , and points their merit out ; Who advertises what reviewers say , With sham editions every second day ; Who dares not trust his praises out of sight , But hurries into fame with all his might ; Although the verse some transient praise obtains , Contempt is all the anxious poet gains . Now Puffs exhausted , Advertisements past , Their Correspondents stand exposed at last ; These are a numerous tribe , to fame unknown , Who for the public good forego their own ; Who volunteers in paper-war engage , With double portion of their party 's rage : Such are the Bruti , Decii , who appear Wooing the printer for admission here ; Whose generous souls can condescend to pray For leave to throw their precious time away . Oh ! cruel WOODFALL ! when a patriot draws His gray-goose quill in his dear country 's cause , To vex and maul a ministerial race , Can thy stern soul refuse the champion place ? Alas ! thou know'st not with what anxious heart He longs his best-loved labours to impart ; How he has sent them to thy brethren round , And still the same unkind reception found : At length indignant will he damn the state , Turn to his trade , and leave us to our fate . These Roman souls , like Rome 's great sons , are known To live in cells on labours of their own . Thus Milo , could we see the noble chief , Feeds , for his country 's good , on legs of beef : Camillus copies deeds for sordid pay , Yet fights the public battles twice a-day : E'en now the godlike Brutus views his score Scroll 'd on the bar-board , swinging with the door : Where , tippling punch , grave Cato 's self you 'll see , And Amor Patriae vending smuggled tea . Last in these ranks , and least , their art 's disgrace , Neglected stand the Muses ’ meanest race ; Scribblers who court contempt , whose verse the eye Disdainful views , and glances swiftly by : This Poet 's Corner is the place they choose , A fatal nursery for an infant Muse ; Unlike that Corner where true Poets lie , These cannot live , and they shall never die ; Hapless the lad whose mind such dreams invade , And win to verse the talents due to trade . Curb then , O youth ! these raptures as they rise , Keep down the evil spirit and be wise ; Follow your calling , think the Muses foes , Nor lean upon the pestle and compose . I know your day-dreams , and I know the snare Hid in your flow'ry path , and cry “ Beware ! ” Thoughtless of ill , and to the future blind , A sudden couplet rushes on your mind ; Here you may nameless print your idle rhymes , And read your first-born work a thousand times ; Th'infection spreads , your couplet grows apace , Stanzas to Delia 's dog or Celia 's face : You take a name ; Philander 's odes are seen , Printed , and praised , in every magazine : Diarian sages greet their brother sage , And your dark pages please th ’ enlightened age. -  Alas ! what years you thus consume in vain , Ruled by this wretched bias of the brain ! Go ! to your desks and counters all return ; Your sonnets scatter , your acrostics burn ; Trade , and be rich ; or , should your careful sires Bequeath your wealth , indulge the nobler fires ; Should love of fame your youthful heart betray , Pursue fair fame , but in a glorious way , Nor in the idle scenes of Fancy 's painting stray . Of all the good that mortal men pursue , The Muse has least to give , and gives to few ; Like some coquettish fair , she leads us on , With smiles and hopes , till youth and peace are gone . Then , wed for life , the restless wrangling pair Forget how constant one , and one how fair : Meanwhile Ambition , like a blooming bride , Brings power and wealth to grace her lover 's side ; And though she smiles not with such flattering charms , The brave will sooner win her to their arms . Then wed to her , if Virtue tie the bands , Go spread your country 's fame in hostile lands ; Her court , her senate , or her arms adorn , And let her foes lament that you were born : Or weigh her laws , their ancient rights defend , Though hosts oppose , be theirs and Reason 's friend ; Arm 'd with strong powers , in their defence engage , And rise the THURLOW of the future age .</docImprint>
