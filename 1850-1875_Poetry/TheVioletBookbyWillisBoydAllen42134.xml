   <head>A STUDY IN VIOLET</head>
   <p>Next to the rose , whose divine right to monarchy cannot be questioned , the violet is the poet 's flower . No other is mentioned so frequently , or with such affection .</p>
   <p>It is impossible to say when this familiar flower first blossomed in literature . The “ Odyssey ” would not be complete without it , nor would the “ Eclogues ” of the Roman singer , Virgil . Ovid was fond of horticulture , and the violet was not forgotten when the bard was inditing his smooth-flowing hexameters . Pliny and Cicero , too , were violet-lovers . In the Bible there is no mention of the flower ; but in Chrysostom 's “ First Homily ” occurs perhaps the first appearance of our little friend in Christian literature .</p>
   <p>Chaucer 's affection for “ floures ” is well known . Of the many Shakspearean quotations in this field , probably the most familiar comprises the exquisite lines :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Violets dim ,</l>
     <l n="2">But sweeter than the lids of Juno 's eyes</l>
     <l n="3">Or Cytherea 's breath . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Passing to the more recent literary period , the individual taste of the poet becomes noticeable . Strange to relate , Wordsworth could have cared little for the shy blossom . Although he does say ,</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Long as there are violets</l>
     <l n="2">They will have their place in story , ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>he leaves it to others to tell the story ,— referring to the violet only three or four times in all his voluminous writings . His counterpart in this respect , among American poets , is Longfellow , in whose musical numbers , singularly enough , the violet has almost no place at all . Nor was the flower a favorite with Tennyson , though each of his rare references to it is a gem ; as this ,—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ The meadow your walks have left so sweet</l>
     <l n="2">That wherever a March wind sighs ,</l>
     <l n="3">He sets the jewel-prints of his feet</l>
     <l n="4">In violets blue as your eyes . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>American writers have , on the whole , given the violet a more prominent place than have their English brethren of the lyre . Bryant 's pages , for instance , are fragrant with its perfume , and he has , in special , immortalized the yellow variety in more than one finely turned stanza .</p>
   <p>If most of the world 's great bards have been reluctant to give Lady Violet her due , not so the numerous rank and file of “ minor poets . ” The verse of Alice Cary , Lucy Larcom , Grace Greenwood , Elizabeth Akers , Adelaide Proctor and dozens of others is a garden of wild-flowers , with the violet leading the dance . Some of the prettiest conceits occur in the writings of authors so obscure that their names are unfamiliar to most readers . For instance , one must look far for a volume of poetry bearing the name of Ethel M. Kelley ; yet these fine lines are attributed to her :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ In her hair the sunbeams nest ,</l>
     <l n="2">And in her eyes the violets blow ,</l>
     <l n="3">While in the summer of her breast</l>
     <l n="4">The songbird thoughts flit to and fro . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The compiler of this book has spent many pleasant hours in culling his violets from the immense field of English and American poetry . Another volume of equal size could readily be made up from extracts containing references to the flower , to say nothing of German , French , Spanish , Italian , and Scandinavian poetry , which has not been considered in his quest .</p>

    <head>The silent , soft and humble heart In the violet 's hidden sweetness breathes . — JAMES G. PERCIVAL .</head>
    <head>CHAPTER ONE</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The air is white with snow-flakes clinging ;</l>
     <l n="2">Between the gusts that come and go</l>
     <l n="3">Methinks I hear the woodlark singing .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="4">Or can it be the breeze is bringing</l>
     <l n="5">The breath of violets ?— Ah , no !</l>
     <l n="6">The air is white with snow-flakes clinging .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="7">It is my lady 's voice that 's stringing</l>
     <l n="8">Its beads of gold to song ; and so</l>
     <l n="9">Methinks I hear the woodlark singing .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>The violets I see upspringing Are in my lady 's eyes , I trow ; The air is white with snow-flakes clinging . — JOHN PAYNE .</p>
   <p>A chaplet on her head she wore ( Heigho , the chaplet ! ) ; Of sweet violets therein was store — She 's sweeter than the violet . — EDMUND SPENSER .</p>
   <p>Tell me , this sweet morn , Tell me all you know ,— Tell me , was I born ? Tell me , did I grow ? Fell I from the blue Like a drop of rain , Then , as violets do , Blossomed up again ? — ROBERT BUCHANAN .</p>
   <p>Misty grew the violets of her eyes . — HELEN B. BOSTWICK .</p>
   <p>The violet loves the sunny bank , The cowslip loves the lea , The scarlet creeper loves the elm ; But I love — thee . — BAYARD TAYLOR .</p>
   <p>Your name pronounced brings to my heart A feeling like the violet 's breath . — COVENTRY PATMORE .</p>
   <p>Out from the leaves of my “ Lucille ” Falls a faded violet . Sweet and faint as its fragrance steal Out from the leaves of my “ Lucille ” Tender memories , and I feel A sense of longing and regret . Out from the leaves of my “ Lucille ” Falls a faded violet . — WALTER LEARNED .</p>
   <p>Be other brows by pleasure 's wreath Or glory 's coronal oppressed , To me the humblest flower seems best , Some sweet wild bloom with dews still wet . So , Love , but kiss a violet — O , Love , but kiss a violet — And fling it to my breast ! — GRACE GREENWOOD .</p>
   <p>Within my reach ! I could have touched ! I might have chanced that way ! Soft sauntered through the village , Sauntered as soft away ! So unsuspected violets Within the fields lie low , Too late for striving fingers That passed an hour ago . — EMILY DICKINSON .</p>
   <p>The silent , soft and humble heart In the violet 's hidden sweetness breathes . — JAMES G. PERCIVAL .</p>
   <p>Perchance the violets o'er my dust Will half betray their buried trust , And say , their blue eyes full of dew , “ She loved you better than you knew . ” — ELIZABETH AKERS ALLEN .</p>
   <p>Nature does not recognize This strife that rends the earth and skies ; No war-dreams vex the winter sleep of clover-heads and daisy-eyes : When blood her grassy altar wets , She sends the pitying violets To heal the outrage with their bloom and cover it with soft regrets . — ELIZABETH AKERS ALLEN .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Sure thou didst flourish once ! and many springs ,</l>
     <l n="2">Many bright mornings , much dew , many showers</l>
     <l n="3">Passed o'er thy head ; many light hearts and wings ,</l>
     <l n="4">Which now are dead , lodged in thy living bowers .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>And still a new succession sings and flies ; Fresh groves grow up , and their green branches shoot Towards the old and still enduring skies ; While the low violet thrives at their root . — HENRY VAUGHAN .</p>
   <p>Blue eyes Whose sleepy lid like snow on violets lies . — THOMAS MOORE .</p>
   <p>Love comes and goes as the free wind blows , That asks not , as it passes , If it touches the head of the roses red Or the violets down in the grasses . — HOSEA G. BLAKE .</p>
   <p>Little maid , a violet Is knocking at your door , Eagerly its message sweet Repeating o'er and o'er : “ Some one sent me with his love ,— Take me , I implore ! ” — ANONYMOUS .</p>
   <p>Where fall the tears of love the rose appears , And where the ground is bright with friendship 's tears , Forget-me-not , and violets , heavenly blue , Spring , glittering with the cheerful drops like dew . — WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT .</p>
   <p>We shall be , as we are , ( Still breathes the secret strain ) Within our Father 's loving care When violets come again . — EMILY S. OAKEY .</p>
   <p>Where wind-flower and violet , amber and white , On south-sloping brooksides should smile in the light , O'er the cold winter beds of their late-waking roots The frosty flake eddies , the ice crystal shoots . — JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER .</p>
   <p>When Roman fields are red with cyclamen , And in the palace gardens you may find , Under great leaves and sheltering briony-bind , Clusters of cream-white violets , O then The ruined city of immortal men Must smile , a little to her fate resigned . — EDMUND W. GOSSE .</p>
   <p>Beside me , where I rest , Thy loving hands will set The flowers that please me best , Moss-rose and violet . — WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT .</p>
   <p>Once in a dream I saw the flowers That bud and bloom in Paradise ; More fair they are than waking eyes Have seen in all this world of ours . And faint the perfume-bearing rose , And faint the lily on its stem , And faint the perfect violet , Compared with them . — CHRISTINA ROSSETTI .</p>
   <p>I do not know The subtle secret of the snow , That hides away the violets Till April teaches them to blow . Enough for me Their tender loveliness to see , Assured that little things and large Fulfil God 's purpose equally . — MARY BRADLEY .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Violet , sweet violet !</l>
     <l n="2">Thine eyes are full of tears ;</l>
     <l n="3">Are they wet ,</l>
     <l n="4">Even yet ,</l>
     <l n="5">With the thoughts of other years ?</l>
     <l n="6">Or with gladness are they full ,</l>
     <l n="7">For the night so beautiful ,</l>
     <l n="8">And longing for those far-off spheres ?</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Violet , dear violet , Thy blue eyes are only wet With joy and love of Him who sent thee , And for the fulfilling sense Of that glad obedience Which made thee all that Nature meant thee . — JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL .</p>
   <p>CHAPTER TWO</p>
   <p>Violets , shy violets , How many hearts with thee compare ! — ANONYMOUS .</p>
   <p>CHAPTER TWO</p>
   <p>Under a mantle of frost-work and snow , Close by the arc of the fairy-queen 's ring , Sleeping in delicate grottoes of ice , Clusters of violets dream of the spring . — D. CHAUNCEY BREWER .</p>
   <p>That strain again ! It had a dying fall : Oh ! it came o'er my ear like the sweet south , That breathes upon a bank of violets Stealing and giving odor . — WILLIAM SHAKSPEARE .</p>
   <p>Slow rose the silken-fringed lids , and eyes Like violets wet with dew drank in the light . — GRACE GREENWOOD .</p>
   <p>The careful little violet , She makes me think of you , Holding her leafy petticoats From out the morning dew . — ALICE CARY .</p>
   <p>The violet breathes , by our door , as sweetly As in the air of her native East . — WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT .</p>
   <p>When the earliest violets ope On the sunniest southern slope , When the air is sweet and keen Ere the full-blown flower is seen , When that blithe , forerunning air Breathes more hope than thou canst bear , Thou , oh buried , broken heart , Into quivering life shalt start . — EDITH M. THOMAS .</p>
   <p>The wind-flowers and the violets were still too sound asleep , Under the snow 's warm blanket , close folded , soft and deep . — CELIA THAXTER .</p>
   <p>Beautiful maid , discreet , Where is the mate that is meet , Meet for thee — strive as he could — Yet will I kneel at thy feet , Fearing another one should , Violet ! — COSMO MONKHOUSE .</p>
   <p>Violets , shy violets , How many hearts with thee compare , Who hide themselves in thickest green , And thence unseen Ravish the enraptured air With sweetness , dewy , fresh and fair ! — ANONYMOUS .</p>
   <p>I think the very violets Are looking the way you 'll come ! — ALICE CARY .</p>
   <p>Once , long ago , in summer 's glow , We threaded , you and I , A garden 's maze of pleasant ways , Whose beauty charmed the eye ,— Where violets bent in sweet content And pinks stood proud and high . — ELIZABETH AKERS ALLEN .</p>
   <p>Then , feeble man , be wise , tak tent How industry can fetch content . Behold the bees where'er they wing , Or through the bonny bowers o ’ spring , Where violets or roses blaw , An ’ siller dew-draps nightly fa ’ . — ROBERT FERGUSON .</p>
   <p>In her hair the sunbeams nest , And in her eyes the violets blow , While in the summer of her breast The songbird thoughts flit to and fro . — ETHEL M. KELLEY .</p>
   <p>Violets steeped in dreamy odors , Humble as the Mother mild , Blue as were her eyes when watching O'er her sleeping child . — ADELAIDE PROCTOR .</p>
   <p>O Mother Nature , kind to every child Blessed with the gift of speech , the gift of grace , Teach thou the modest violet , shy and wild , To look with trustfulness into my face . — ISAAC B. CHOATE .</p>
   <p>In Farsistan the violet spreads Its leaves to the rival sky . — RALPH WALDO EMERSON .</p>
   <p>My love , whose lips are softer far Than drowsy poppy petals are , And sweeter than the violet . — ANDREW LANG .</p>
   <p>From wintry days blue violets shrink From wintry lives blue eyes will turn . — HARRISON ROBERTSON .</p>
   <p>Her eyes be like the violets Ablow in Sudbury lane ; When she doth smile , her face is sweet As blossoms after rain . — LIZETTE WOODWORTH REESE .</p>
   <p>Through jocund reel , or measured tread Of stately minuet , Like fairy vision shone the bloom Of rose and violet , As , hand in hand with Washington , The hero of the day , The smiling face and nymph-like grace Of Nancy led the way . — ZITELLA COCKE .</p>
   <p>You violets that first appear , By your pure purple mantles known Like the proud virgins of the year , As if the spring were all your own ,— What are you when the Rose is blown ? — SIR HENRY WOTTON .</p>
   <p>Rock-gnawing lichens that forerun the feet Of violets . — JOHN T. TROWBRIDGE .</p>
   <p>True Brahmin , in the meadows wet , Expound the Vedas of the violet ! — RALPH WALDO EMERSON .</p>
   <p>Soon again shall music swell the breeze ; Soon , issuing forth , shall glitter through the trees Vestures of nuptial white ; and hymns be sung And violets scattered round ; and old and young In every cottage porch with garlands green , Stand still to gaze , and gazing , bless the scene ; While , her dark eyes declining , by his side , Moves in her virgin veil the gentle bride . — SAMUEL ROGERS .</p>
   <p>Der Mai ist da mit seinen goldnen Lichtern Und seinen Lueften und gewuerzten Dueften , Und freundlich lockt er mit den weissen Bluethen , Und grusst aus tausend blauen Veilchenaugen . — HEINRICH HEINE .</p>
   <p>I only know That she was very true and good : The queenliest lily cannot match The shy , sweet violet of the wood . — WEATHERLY .</p>
   <p>Her bloom the rose outvies , The lily dares no plea , The violet 's glory dies , No flower so sweet can be ; When love is in her eyes What need of spring for me ? — ANNA MARIA FAY .</p>
   <p>Who is there can sing of a more divine thing Than the edge of the woods in the edge of the spring , Ere the violets peep , while hepaticas sleep , And still in the hollows the snow-drifts lie deep ? — MILDRED G. PHILLIPS .</p>
   <p>The erthe was ful softe and swete . Through moysture of the welle wete Sprong up the sote grene , grene gras , As fayre , as thycke , as myster was . But moche amended it the place That therthe was of such a grace That it of floures hath plente , That both in somer and wynter be . There sprange the vyolet al newe , And fresshe pervynke ryche of hewe , And floures yelowe , white and rede ; Such plente grewe there never in mede . Ful gaye was al the grounde , and queynt , And poudred , as men had it peynt , With many a freshe and sondry floure That casten up ful good savoure . — GEOFFREY CHAUCER .</p>
   <p>Low lilies press about thy feet With violets changing kisses sweet . — JANE AUSTIN .</p>

     <l n="1">Come up , come up , O soft spring airs ,</l>
     <l n="2">Come from your silver shining seas ,</l>
     <l n="3">Where all day long you toss the wave</l>
     <l n="4">About the low and palm-plumed keys !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>For here the violet in the wood Thrills with the fulness you shall take , And wrapped away from life and love The wild rose dreams , and fain would wake . — HARRIET PRESCOTT SPOFFORD .</p>

    <head>CHAPTER THREE</head>
    <head>Hear the rain whisper , “ Dear violet , come . ” — LUCY LARCOM .</head>
    <head>CHAPTER THREE</head>
     <l n="1">The brown buds thicken on the trees ,</l>
     <l n="2">Unbound , the free streams sing ,</l>
     <l n="3">As March leads forth , across the leas ,</l>
     <l n="4">The wild and windy spring .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Where in the fields the melted snow Leaves hollows warm and wet , Ere many days will sweetly blow The first blue violet . — ELIZABETH AKERS ALLEN .</p>
   <p>Along the wood-paths , warm and wet , Springs up the frail wood-violet . — JAMES BENJAMIN KENYON .</p>
   <p>The wild Winds clash and clang , and broken boughs are piled At feet of writhing trees . The violets raise Their heads without affright , without amaze , And sleep through all the din , as sleeps a child . — HELEN HUNT JACKSON .</p>
   <p>Violet is for faithfulness , Which in me shall abide . — ANONYMOUS .</p>
   <p>Such sweet prophetic gladness as we feel When first we find beneath the bare spring hills So lately circled by the whirling snows , The crocus peeping from the withered leaves ; When first we see the lingering day of flowers Dawning in violets blue . — GRACE GREENWOOD .</p>
   <p>The violet varies from the lily as far As oak from elm . — ALFRED TENNYSON .</p>
   <p>Some wear the lily 's stainless white And some the rose of passion , And some the violet 's heavenly blue , But each in its own fashion . — HENRY VAN DYKE .</p>
   <p>Beauty clear and fair Where the air Rather like a perfume dwells ; Where the violet and the rose Their blue veins and blush disclose And come to honor nothing else . — SAMUEL FLETCHER .</p>
   <p>No tree unfolds its timid bud , Chill pours the hillside 's chilling flood , The tuneless forest all is dumb — Whence then , fair violet , didst thou come ? — GOODRICH .</p>
   <p>All flowers died when Eve left Paradise , And all the world was flowerless for a while , Until a little child was laid in earth ; Then from its grave grew violets for its eyes , And from its lips rose-petals for its smile . — MAURICE FRANCIS EGAN .</p>
   <p>Sweet and sad , like a white dove 's note , Strange voices wakened my soul to glee , And soft scents strayed from the violet 's throat . — BERNARD WELLER .</p>
   <p>When the rain beats and March winds blow , We should be glad if we could know How , not so very far away , There shineth a serener day Where birds are blithe , and happy children pass To gather violets among the grass . — EMILY S. OAKEY .</p>
   <p>Like a violet , like a lark , Like the dawn that kills the dark , Like a dew-drop , trembling , clinging , Is the poet 's first sweet singing . — RICHARD WATSON GILDER .</p>
   <p>Earth folds dark blankets round the violet blue . — AUSTIN DOBSON .</p>
   <p>Her mild eyes were innocent of ill As violets in sheltered nooks enshrined . — CARRYL .</p>
   <p>O violets , who never fret , nor say , “ I wo n't ! ” “ I will ! ” Who only live to do your best His wishes to fulfil , Teach us your sweet obedience . — CELIA THAXTER .</p>
   <p>When beechen buds begin to swell , And woods the bluebird 's warble know , The yellow violet 's modest bell Peeps from the last year 's leaves below . — WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT .</p>
   <p>I hold thy violets against my face And deeply breathe the haunting purple scent That fills my weary heart with sweet content And lays upon my soul a chrismal grace ; The air around me for a little space Is heavy with the fragrance they have lent , And every passing wind that heavenward went Has held thy blossoms in a close embrace . — MYRTLE REED .</p>
   <p>‘ Twas when the spring was coming , when the snow Had melted , and fresh winds began to blow , And girls were selling violets in the town . — ROBERT BUCHANAN .</p>
   <p>My house is small and low ; But with pictures such as these ,— Of the sunset , and the row Of illuminated trees , And the heifer as she drinks From the field of meadowed ground , With the violets and the pinks For a border all around ,— Let me never , foolish , pray For a vision wider spread , But , contented , only say , Give me , Lord , my daily bread . — ALICE CARY .</p>
   <p>How can our fancies help but go Out from this realm of mist and rain , Out from this realm of sleet and snow , When the first southern violets blow ? — THOMAS BAILEY ALDRICH .</p>
   <p>But one short week ago the trees were bare , And winds were keen , and violets pinched with frost ; Today the spring is in the air . — JOHN TODHUNTER .</p>
   <p>Are there violets in the sod , Crocuses beneath the clod ? When will Boreas give us peace ? Or has Winter signed a lease For another month of frost , Leaving Spring to pay the cost ? For it seems he still is king , Though ‘ tis spring . — CHRISTOPHER PEARSE CRANCH .</p>
   <p>See , the violets call from out the grasses , Look , the purple answers from the ground ; Azure melts and to that warbler passes , Sudden , a sky-fleck on the fences found ! — CHARLES DE KAY .</p>
   <p>I know that thou art the word of my God , dear violet . — SIDNEY LANIER .</p>
   <p>On sheltered banks , beneath the dripping eaves , Spring 's earliest nurselings spread their glowing leaves , Bright with the hues from wider pictures won , White , azure , golden ,— drift , or sky , or sun ;— The snowdrop , bearing on her patient breast The frozen trophy torn from winter 's crest ; The violet , gazing on the arch of blue Till her own iris wears its deepened hue ; The spendthrift crocus , bursting through the mould , Naked and shivering with his cup of gold . — OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES .</p>
   <p>The meadow your walks have left so sweet That wherever a March wind sighs , He sets the jewel-print of your feet In violets blue as your eyes . — ALFRED TENNYSON .</p>

   <p>Slowly the victor Spring her foe outflanks , And countermines his snows ; Then , unawares , along the grassy banks , Her ambushed violets throws . — CHRISTOPHER P. CRANCH .</p>
   <p>Knowledge this man prizes best Seems fantastic to the rest : Pondering shadows , colors , clouds , Grass-buds and caterpillar shrouds , Boughs on which the wild bees settle , Tints that spot the violet 's petal . — RALPH WALDO EMERSON .</p>
   <p>But who hath breathed the scent of violets And not that moment been some lover glad ? — ARLO BATES .</p>
   <p>What blooms here , Filling the honeyed atmosphere With faint , delicious fragrances , Freighted with blessed memories ? The earliest March violet , Dear as the image of Regret , And beautiful as Hope . — EMMA LAZARUS .</p>
   <p>Violets and bilberry bells , Maple-sap and daffodels , Grass with green flag half-mast high . — RALPH WALDO EMERSON .</p>
   <p>Pit , pat , patter , clatter , Sudden sun , and clatter , patter ! First the blue and then the shower ; Bursting bud and smiling flower ; Brooks set free with tinkling ring ; Birds too full of song to sing ; Crisp old leaves astir with pride , Where the timid violets hide : All things ready with a will — April 's coming up the hill ! — MARY MAPES DODGE .</p>
   <p>Violets suit when homebirds build and sing . — CHRISTINA ROSSETTI .</p>
   <p>Radiant Sister of the Day , Awake , arise , and come away To the wild woods and the plains ; To the pools where winter rains Image all their roof of leaves ; Where the pine its garland weaves , Of sapless green and ivy dim , Round stems that never kiss the sun ; Where the lawns and pastures be , And the sand-hills of the sea ; Where the melting hoar-frost wets The daisy-star that never sets ; And wind-flowers and violets , Which yet join not scent to hue , Crown the pale year , weak and new . — PERCY BYSSHE SHELLEY .</p>

   <p>One morn a lad cried in the street , “ Fresh violets ! ” and , as in answer sweet , A bluebird flung , bouquet-like , clear and strong , Athwart the misty window , his first song . — WILLIAM STRUTHERS .</p>
   <p>The April morn Climbs softly up the eastern sky , And glimmers through the milk-white thorn , Or dances where the violets lie . — SAMUEL MINTURN PECK .</p>

   <p>It is n't raining rain to me , but fields of clover bloom , Where any buccaneering bee can find a bed and room ; A health unto the happy , and a fig for him who frets ! It is n't raining rain to me , it 's raining violets . — ANONYMOUS .</p>
   <p>She walked across the fields icebound , Like some shy , sunny hint of spring , And stooping suddenly she found A violet , a dainty thing , Which shunned the chilly light of day Until sweet Aprille came that way . — HARRISON ROBERTSON .</p>
   <p>The violet trills , through the bluebird , Of the heaven that within her she feels . — LUCY LARCOM .</p>

   <p>And now the other violets are crowding up to see What welcome in this blustering world may chance for them to be . They lift themselves on slender stems in every shaded place , Heads over heads , all turned one way , wonder in every face . — LUCY LARCOM .</p>
   <p>It is April , crying sore and weeping O'er the chilly earth so brown and bare . “ When I went away , ” she murmurs , sobbing , “ All my violet banks were starred with blue ; Who , O who has been here , basely robbing Bloom and odor from the fragrant crew ? ” Thus she plaineth . Then ten million voices Tiny , murmurous , like drops of rain , Raised in song as when the wind rejoices , Ring the answer , “ We are here again ! ” — SARAH CHANNING WOOLSEY .</p>
   <p>Now fades the last long streak of snow , Now bourgeons every maze of quick About the flowering squares , and thick By ashen roots the violets grow . — ALFRED TENNYSON .</p>
   <p>Violets now , that strew The green lap of the new-come spring . — WILLIAM SHAKSPEARE .</p>

   <p>Violets , Which April ne'er forgets ! — EMILY S. OAKEY .</p>

   <p>A wealth of clover clothes the place Where , clad in buff-lined coats of blue , Our countrymen o'erthrew Their alien foe ; and violets efface All signs of combat . — D. CHAUNCEY BREWER .</p>

   <p>Here the first violets Perhaps will bud unseen , And a dove , maybe , Return to nestle here . — CHRISTINA ROSSETTI .</p>
   <p>In winter , when the garden-plots were bare , And deep winds piloted the shriven snow , He saw its gleaming in the cottage fire , While , with a book of botany on his knee , He sat and hunger 'd for a breath of spring . Here beds of roses sweetened all the page ; Here lilies whiter than the falling snow Crept gleaming softly from the printed lines ; Here dewy violets sparkled till the book Dazzled his eyes with rays of misty blue . — ROBERT BUCHANAN .</p>

   <p>A duller sense than mine should feel The stir in nature 's warming soul ; It makes the shouting bluebirds reel , And bursts the violet 's twisted scroll . — GEORGE HENRY BOKER .</p>
   <p>I see Thee in the distant blue , But in the violet 's dell of dew , Behold , I breathe and touch Thee , too . — JOHN B. TABB .</p>
   <p>Spring sat dejected in a sheltered nook And sighed because of the long-lingering snow , And prayed that warm , life-giving winds might blow ; When at her feet there grew , with trembling look , A violet that whispered : “ I forsook My cell to comfort thee and still thy woe . ” Then , filled with hope , Spring said : “ I now shall go And greet each hill and vale and winding brook . ” Where'er she went , earth blessed her with its flowers : Arbutus , columbines , anemones , And sunny marigolds that deck the wet Lowlands . But in the soothing moonlit hours , When dreaming ‘ neath the blossom-laden trees , She holds with loving hands the violet . — JOHN LUTHER BRENIZER .</p>

   <p>I used to go and watch them , Both night and morning , too :— It was my tears , I fancy , That kept the violets blue . — ADELAIDE PROCTOR .</p>
   <p>My girl hath violet eyes and yellow hair , A soft hand , like a lady 's , soft and fair , A sweet face pouting in a white straw bonnet , A tiny foot , and little boot upon it . — ROBERT BUCHANAN .</p>
   <p>Here the first violets Perhaps will bud unseen , And a dove , maybe , Return to nestle here . — CHRISTINA ROSSETTI .</p>
   <p>Gold violets , bright violets , The sparkling dew at sunrise wets , And doth with nectar overbrim ; Lustre no cloudy day can dim ; The golden sun doth shine upon And call his children rare ; The yellow-bird hath sometimes stirred Drawn downward unaware . — EMILY S. OAKEY .</p>
   <p>Lay her in lilies and in violets . — EDMUND SPENSER .</p>
   <p>The violet 's blue , The rose bloom 's red ,— and friends are tried and true ; The blossoms on the boughs are white in spring , The wind is soft , the birds spread joyous wing , And soar and wheel in the blue sky , and sing , Because — because I love you . — FRANCES HODGSON BURNETT .</p>
   <p>In languid luxury soft she glides Encircled by the azure tides , Like some fair lily , faint with weeping , Upon a bed of violets sleeping . — THOMAS MOORE .</p>
   <p>E'en now what affection the violet awakes ; What loved little islands , twice seen in their lakes , Can the wild water-lily restore ! — THOMAS CAMPBELL .</p>
   <p>Then by the enchantress Fancy led , On violet banks I lay my head . — JAMES MONTGOMERY .</p>
   <p>The air is sweet with violets running wild ‘ Mid broken friezes and fallen capitals . — SAMUEL ROGERS .</p>

   <p>Flowers were the couch , Pansies and violets , and asphodels , And hyacinths , earth 's freshest , softest lap . — JOHN MILTON .</p>
   <p>Flowers , of such as keep Their fragrant tissues and their heavenly hues Fresh-bathed forever in eternal dews — The violet with her low-drooped eye , For learned modesty . — SIDNEY LANIER .</p>
   <p>Before the urchin well could go , She stole the whiteness of the snow ; And more — the whiteness to adorn , She stole the blushes of the morn : Stole all the sweets that ether sheds On primrose buds or violet beds . If lovers , Cupid , are thy care , Exert thy vengeance on this fair ; To trial bring her stolen charms , And let her prison be my arms . — CHARLES WYNDHAM .</p>
   <p>Thine old-world eyes — each one a violet — Big as the baby rose that is thy mouth — Sets me a-dreaming . Have our eyes not met In childhood — in a garden of the South ? — HENRY A . BEERS .</p>
   <p>May his soft foot , where it treads , Gardens thence produce , and meads , And those meddowes full be set With the rose and violet . — ROBERT HERRICK .</p>
   <p>I remember , I remember , The roses , red and white , The violets and the lily-cups — Those flowers made of light . — THOMAS HOOD .</p>
   <p>The light drop of dew That glows in the violet 's eye , In the splendor of morn , to the fugitive view , May rival a star in the sky . — JAMES MONTGOMERY .</p>
   <p>I saw thee weep — the big bright tear Came o'er that eye of blue : And then methought it did appear A violet dropping dew . — LORD BYRON .</p>
   <p>Oh Stream of Life ! the violet springs But once beside thy bed ; But one brief summer , on thy path , The dews of heaven are shed . — WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT .</p>
   <p>Whate'er the baffling power Sent anger and earthquake , and a thousand ills — It made the violet flower , And the wide world with breathless beauty thrills . — RICHARD WATSON GILDER .</p>

    <head>CHAPTER TWELVE</head>
     <l n="1">O Winter , thou art warm at heart ;</l>
     <l n="2">Thine every pulse doth throb and glow ,</l>
     <l n="3">And thou dost feel life 's joy and smart ,</l>
     <l n="4">Beneath the blinding snow .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Thine is the scent of bursting bud , Of April shower and violet ; Thou feelest spring in all thy blood Yearn up like sweet regret . — JAMES BENJAMIN KENYON .</p>
   <p>Bare are the places where the sweet flowers dwelt . What joy sufficient hath November felt , What profit from the violets ’ day of pain ? — HELEN HUNT JACKSON .</p>
   <p>Pluck the others , but still remember Their herald out of dim December — The morning-star of all the flowers , The pledge of daylight 's lengthened hours ; Nor , midst the roses , e'er forget The virgin , virgin violet . — LORD BYRON .</p>
   <p>Violet , little violet , Brave and true and sweet thou art . May is in thy sunny heart , Maiden violet . Gentle as the summer day , Wintry storms bring no dismay , Winsome violet . All the days to thee are spring , Thine own sunshine dost thou bring , Violet , faithful violet ! — ANONYMOUS .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Only in dreams thy love comes back ,</l>

     <l n="3">Only in dreams I feel thy heart</l>
     <l n="4">Once more beat close to mine .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Only in blissful dreams of spring , And sunny banks of violet blue , The past folds back its curtain dim And memory shows thine image true . — MELVILLE M. BIGELOW .</p>
   <p>Winter is come again . There is no voice Of waters with beguiling for your ear , And the cool forest and the meadows green Witch not your feet away ; and in the dells There are no violets . — NATHANIEL P. WILLIS .</p>
   <p>Once more , dear friend , the violet bank we seek , And tread with joy our old familiar ways . — JESSIE CUNNINGHAM HOWDEN .</p>
   <p>Cheek o'er cheek , and with red so tender Rippling bright through the gypsy brown , Just to see how a lady 's splendor Shone the heads of the daffodils down . Winds through the violets ’ misty covering Now kissed the white ones and now the blue , Sang the redbreast over them hovering All as the world were but just made new . — ALICE CARY .</p>
   <p>Daffodils , That come before the swallow dares , and take The winds of March with beauty ; violets , dim But sweeter than the lids of Juno 's eyes Or Cytherea 's breath . — WILLIAM SHAKSPEARE .</p>
   <p>Could you not come when woods are green ? Could you not come when lambs are seen ? When the primrose laughs from its child-like sleep , And the violets hide and the bluebells peep ? — ALFRED AUSTIN .</p>
   <p>Thy face is like the violet 's That to the red rose lingers close , And he who looks at thee forgets The honeyed sweetness of the rose . — JOEL BENTON .</p>
   <p>He gave her the wildwood roses And violets for her wreath , And a whisper at last of sweet response Stole on her perfumed breath . — FRANCES L. MACE .</p>
   <p>Come not , O sweet days , Out of yon cloudless blue , Ghosts of so many dear remembered Mays , With faces like dead lovers , who died true . Come not , lest we go seek with eyes all wet , Primrose and violet , Forgetting that they lie Deep in the mould till winter has gone by . — DINAH MARIA MULOCH CRAIK .</p>
   <p>Blighting and blowing — blighting and blowing — And the stones of the rivulet silent lie , And the winds in the fading woodlands cry , And the birds in the clouds are going ; And the dandelion hides his gold , And their little blue tents the violets fold , And the air is gray with snowing : So life keeps coming and going . — ALICE CARY .</p>
   <p>Dear chance it were in some rough wood-god 's lair . . . . . . To sink o'erdrowsed , and dream that wild-flowers blew Around my head and feet silently there , Till spring 's glad choir adown the valley pealed And violets trembled in the morning dew . — EDWARD DOWDEN .</p>

     <l n="1">The sunbeams kiss askant the sombre hill ,</l>

   <p>You 'll look at least on love 's remains , A grave 's one violet ? Your look ?— that pays a thousand pains . What 's death ? You 'll love me yet ! — ROBERT BROWNING .</p>
   <p>Out of every shadowy nook Spirit faces seem to look , Some with smiling eyes , and some With a sad entreaty dumb ; He who shepherded his sheep On the wild Sicilian steep , He above whose grave are set Sprays of Roman violet ; Poets , sages ,— all who wrought In the crucible of thought . — CLINTON SCOLLARD .</p>

     <l n="1">A fair little girl sat under a tree</l>
     <l n="2">Sewing as long as her eyes could see ;</l>

   </lg>
   <p>The tall pink foxglove bowed his head ; The violets curtsied and went to bed ; And good little Lucy tied up her hair , And said , on her knees , her favorite prayer . — RICHARD MONCKTON MILNES .</p>
   <p>My banks they are furnished with bees , Whose murmur invites one to sleep ; My grottoes are shaded with trees , And my hills are white over with sheep ; I seldom have met with a loss , Such health do my fountains bestow ; My fountains all bordered with moss , Where the harebells and violets grow . — WILLIAM SHENSTONE .</p>
   <p>Where the fern in gladness dances On the banks of dimpled burns , Where the streamlet 's bright wave glances When the spring returns ; White as winter 's spotless drift There our faces we uplift . Still we see the stars above us , Still we trust , because they love us — Are they flowers in the sky , Violets that have learned to fly ? We believe , and hope , and trust , Know that He who made is just , And He never will forsake us While we 're white and pure of heart . Sister , maiden Sister , take us — One of us thou art ! — WILLIS BOYD ALLEN .</p>
   <p>O violets , sweet blue eyes of the spring ! — DEXTER SMITH .</p>
   <p>Here 's the violet 's modest blue , That ‘ neath hawthorns hides from view . While they choose each lovely spot , The sun disdains them not ; So I 've brought the flowers to plead And win a smile from thee . — JOHN CLARE .</p>

     <l n="1">Last night I found the violets</l>
     <l n="2">You sent me once across the sea ;</l>
     <l n="3">From gardens that the winter frets ,</l>
     <l n="4">In summer lands they came to me .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Still fragrant of the English earth , Still hurried from the frozen dew , To me they spoke of Christmas mirth , They spoke of England , spoke of you . — ANDREW LANG .</p>
   <p>Darling , walk with me this morn ; Let your brown tresses drink its sheen ; These violets , within them worn , Of floral fays shall make you queen . — EDMUND CLARENCE STEDMAN .</p>
   <p>O faint , delicious , springtime violet ! Thine odor , like a key , Turns noiselessly in memory 's wards to let A thought of sorrow free . — WILLIAM W. STORY .</p>
   <p>The violet , Spring 's little infant , stands Girt in thy purple swaddling-bands ; On the fair tulip thou dost dote , Thou cloth'st it in a gay and party-colored coat . — ABRAHAM COWLEY .</p>

   <p>Good-bye to the red rose that is your mouth , The tender violets that are your sigh ; The sweetness that you are — that is my South — Ah , not too soon , Enchantress , do I fly !— Tell me good-bye ! — RICHARD WATSON GILDER .</p>
   <p>Through the deep drifts the south wind breathed its way Down to the earth 's green face ; the air grew warm , The snowdrops had regained their lovely charm ; The world had melted round them in a day : My full heart longed for violets . — CHARLES TENNYSON-TURNER .</p>
   <p>The sweetness of the violet 's deep blue eyes , Kissed by the breath of heaven , seems colored by its skies . — LORD BYRON .</p>
   <p>When we were children we would say ,— “ I like the coming of the spring , I like the violets of May , I like , why , almost everything That March and May and April bring . ” But now we value less the rose , And care not when the birds take wing . We like the winter and the snows . — JAMES BERRY BENSEL .</p>
   <p>So long as there 's a sun that sets , Primroses will have their glory ; Long as there are violets They will have a place in story . — WILLIAM WORDSWORTH .</p>
   <p>Go , azure myrtle blossom , Go , violets and jasmine fair , And star the darkness of her hair , Or faint against her bosom . — GRACE GREENWOOD .</p>
